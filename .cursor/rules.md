# Coding Standards

## Code Organization

- **Modularization**: All code must be modularized. Break down functionality into logical, reusable modules and components.

- **File Length**: Files must not exceed 150 lines of code. If a file approaches this limit, refactor it into smaller, more focused modules.

- **Class Organization**: Each class must have its own file. One class per file to maintain clear separation of concerns and improve code readability.

- **DRY Principle**: Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) must be strictly applied. Avoid code duplication by extracting common functionality into reusable functions, classes, or modules.
